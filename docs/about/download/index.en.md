!!! tip "Android user"

!!! tip "Windows user"

    If you don't have any vc redist package installed,
    you should download and install the latest version of `MSVBCRT.AIO` or
    [latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe){target="_blank"}.

    To extract '.zip' archive file, we recommend [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org){target="_blank"} or

!!! tip "Linux user"

    requires `gtk3`.

    Playback audio supports `PipeWire/PortAudio/PulseAudio/JACK` backends, if you can't play
    then you should manually install one of the above.

    If you cannot run the game, please run the command `ldd ./NarutoSenkiV2` in game root directory
    to display all dependencies and install all missing dependencies manually.

!!! tip "iOS user"

    Jailbreak required. (Don't do it unless you know what you are doing!)

    Or use ios signing software to avoid jailbreak.

    It is also recommended to look for Android Emulators.

    This is a universal binary on Mac that you can run on x64 and arm64 (M1+) devices.
