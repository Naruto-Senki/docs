    1. If you already have the old redist package installed,
    you can just download the following packages.

        `For windows 64-bit, it's recommended to install both of the following.`

    Maybe some Linux distributions don't use `PulseAudio` to play audio,
    then you should install `PulseAudio` manually.

    If you cannot run the game, please run the command `ldd ./NarutoSenki` in game root directory
    to display all dependencies and install all missing dependencies manually.

    Jailbreak required.
